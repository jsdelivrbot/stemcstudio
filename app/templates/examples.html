          </p>
          <p>
          The Eight.Js library that ships with MathDoodle has a coherent layered architecture that allows
          you to choose the appropriate level for flexibility and reuse. Eight.Js integrates Geometric
          Algebra with WebGL Graphics providing an efficient starting point for explorations into Geometry,
          Physics, Mathematics and Computing.
          </p>
          <p>
          This example demonstrates many features of the Eight.Js library. It builds a scene from high level
          components and drives the animation using Geometric Algebra for computation.
          </p>
          <p>
          May be a good starting point for Physics explorations.
          </p>
          <p>
          This example is rather verbose and contains boilerplate code that could be
          eliminated with an appropriate application framework. However, the explicit
          nature of the example makes it easier to understand the various components and
          how they interact.

          Replacing the labels used for basis vectors can be an instructive way to learn the

          <p>
          Replacing the labels used for basis vectors can be an instructive way to learn the
          relationships between geometric measures, geometric quantities, magnitudes, directions,
          aspect, orientation, and units of measure.
          </p>
          <p>
          Basis labels can also be customized appropriate to the context, e.g. compass directions. In this example
          we use Unicode graphical symbols to represent vectors, bivectors and the pseudoscalar and show how they
          interact under the geometric product.

          <p>
          While WebGL provides a high performance real-time graphics environment, movie-quality animations
          require Physics calculations based upon Geometric Optics and are often computed off-line taking many
          hours.
          </p>

          This example shows how simple ray tracing can be performed in the browser with the results written
          out to the HTML5 Canvas in a few seconds. The example is due to Microsoft. It would be interesting
          to adapt it to Geometric Algebra and enable learning Geometric Optics.
