          Overview
        </h1>
        <p class='lead'>
          The principle behind MathDoodle is to provide a learning environment in which the student can verify personal understanding and conceptual models by constructing a working software model. It is hoped that working with a computer, sometimes in collaboration with others, will provide a non-threatening environment, clarify understanding, challenge mastery, and motivate further exploration.

              Use the tools that are the bread-and-butter of a contemporary software developer.
              The modeling-development environment is general purpose and allows external libraries to be used and services to be called over the internet.

            <dt>TypeScript Language</dt>
            <dd>
              TypeScript is JavaScript with otional type information and features taken from future JavaScript releases.
              Using TypeScript provides intelligent checking and context-sensitive help allowing the student to spend more time focussing on the task in hand instead of trying to find errors or lookup documentation.

            <dd>
              Allows you to work even in situations with limited internet connectivity.
              Your work is automatically saved locally in the browser and can be uploaded when connectivity becomes available.

            <dt>Cloud Sharing</dt>
            <dd>
              Students and educators can store their work permanently in their personal and free GitHub account. Educators may use GitHub as a means to create and distribute assignments, while students may use GitHub to provide a permanent record of their work and as a means for sharing.

            <dt>Operator Overloading</dt>
            <dd>
              MathDoodle supports a rich set of mathematical operators for performing multivector analysis.
              In addition to the usual arithmetic operators, there is support for inner and outer products, as well as left and right contraction.

            <dt>Geometric Algebra</dt>
            <dd>
              MathDoodle supports libraries for perfoming Geometric Algebra computations in 2D and 3D Euclidean geometries.
