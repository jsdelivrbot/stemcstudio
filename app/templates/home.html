        <p class='lead'>
          The principle behind MathDoodle is to provide a learning environment in which the student can verify personal understanding and conceptual models by constructing a working software model. This learning environment takes the form of a general-purpose software development environment optimized for Mathematics and Computer Graphics. Programming a computer, sometimes in collaboration with others, provides a non-threatening environment, clarifies understanding, challenges mastery, and motivates further exploration.

              Use the tools that are the bread-and-butter of a contemporary software developer.
              The modeling-development environment is general purpose and allows external libraries to be used and services to be called over the internet.

            <dt>TypeScript Language</dt>
            <dd>
              TypeScript is JavaScript with optional type information and features taken from future JavaScript releases.
              Using TypeScript provides intelligent checking and context-sensitive help, allowing the student to spend more time focusing on the task in hand instead of trying to find errors or lookup documentation.

            <dt>Local Caching</dt>
            <dd>
              Allows you to work even in situations with limited internet connectivity.
              Your work is automatically saved locally in the browser and can be uploaded when connectivity becomes available.

            <dt>Cloud Sharing</dt>
            <dd>
              Students and educators can store their work permanently in their personal and free GitHub account. Educators may use GitHub as a means to create and distribute assignments, while students may use GitHub to provide a permanent record of their work and as a means for sharing.
            </dd>
            <dt>Operator Overloading</dt>
            <dd>
              Operator Overloading is essential for making mathematical programming look natural
              when dealing with structured types such as vectors and matrices. MathDoodle supports a rich set of mathematical operators (useful for performing multivector analysis). In addition to the usual arithmetic operators, there is support for inner and outer products, as well as left and right contraction. These operators may be used with your own custom datatypes. Operator Overloading is optional.

            <dt>Geometric Algebra Library</dt>
            <dd>
              MathDoodle provides a library (davinci-eight a.k.a 'EIGHT') for perfoming Geometric Algebra computations in 2D and 3D Euclidean geometries.
            </dd>
            <dt>WebGL Mathematical Computer Graphics Library</dt>
            <dd>
              MathDoodle provides a library (davinci-eight a.k.a 'EIGHT') that helps to manage the complexity of WebGL shader programs rather than trying to hide it. This is important for high-performance graphics and mathematical flexibility.
            </dd>
            <dt>Units of Measure</dt>
            <dd>
              MathDoodle incorporates a library (davinci-eight a.k.a 'EIGHT') that combines geometric quantities with units to create measures. Students can explore dimensional analysis and the S.I. system of units. Calculations may be performed without units or by carrying through units.

          A STEM Curriculum for the 21st Century
        </h1>

        Learning Geometric Algebra through Computational Modeling and Computer Graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am frequently asked whether there is a curriculum for learning Geometric Algebra
        at the middle and high-school level using MathDoodle to practice the concepts.
        To address this need I have created a blog in which I will capture a possible
        approach. I hope this will be a proving ground for developing a new curriculum.
        The <a href='http://www.geometricphysics.org'>Geometric Physics</a> blog will explain the pedagogic philosophy, incrementally develop the necessary mathematical theory for Geometric Algebra, provide the practical information for
        using MathDoodle and related technologies, and finally guide the student or
        educator in developing their own geometric numbers, computations and graphics.
        Once the necessary mathematical and computing infrastructure has been developed,
        it will be applied to understand the laws of Physics which are described geometrically.

          Audience
        </h1>
        <p class='lead'>
        MathDoodle is a general purpose mathematical tool for the scientific community.
        </p>
        <p>
        MathDoodle was conceived to tackle the problem of learning geometry effectively, but
        its general purpose nature makes it useful to a much wider audience. At the youngest
        end of the spectrum it can be used as the first introduction to a grown-up programming
        language. In the middle of the spectrum the tool may be used for learning and experiencing mathematical geometry with the programming being second-nature. Educators may
        use MathDoodle for demonstration purposes or to set hands-on problems. Researchers may use the tool for convenient computation, exploring problems, or to present their work.
