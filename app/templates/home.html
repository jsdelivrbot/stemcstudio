                    The principle behind STEMCstudio is to provide a learning environment in which the student can verify personal understanding
                    and conceptual models by constructing a working software model. This learning environment takes the form
                    of a general-purpose software development environment optimized for Mathematics and Computer Graphics.
                    Programming a computer, sometimes in collaboration with others, provides a non-threatening environment,
                    clarifies understanding, challenges mastery, and motivates further exploration.

                            as vectors and matrices. STEMCstudio supports a rich set of mathematical operators (useful for
                            performing multivector analysis). In addition to the usual arithmetic operators, there is support
                            for inner and outer products, as well as left and right contraction. These operators may be used
                            with your own custom datatypes. Operator Overloading is optional.

                            graphics abstractions in this library are similar to the popular 3D WebGL library called <i>THREE</i>.
                            The name EIGHT alludes to 2<sup>3</sup>, which is the number of basis elements in the corresponding

                <p>
                    I am frequently asked whether there is a curriculum for learning Geometric Algebra at the middle and high-school level using
                    STEMCstudio to practice the concepts. To address this need I have created a blog in which I will capture
                    a possible approach. I hope this will be a proving ground for developing a new curriculum. The
                    <a href='http://www.geometricphysics.org'>Geometric Physics</a> blog will explain the pedagogic philosophy,
                    incrementally develop the necessary mathematical theory for Geometric Algebra, provide the practical
                    information for using STEMCstudio and related technologies, and finally guide the student or educator
                    in developing their own geometric numbers, computations and graphics. Once the necessary mathematical
                    and computing infrastructure has been developed, it will be applied to understand the laws of Physics
                    which are described geometrically.

                    STEMCstudio was conceived to tackle the problem of learning geometry effectively, but its general purpose nature makes it
                    useful to a much wider audience. At the youngest end of the spectrum it can be used as the first introduction
                    to a grown-up programming language. In the middle of the spectrum the tool may be used for learning and
                    experiencing mathematical geometry with the programming being second-nature. Educators may use STEMCstudio
                    for demonstration purposes or to set hands-on problems. Researchers may use the tool for convenient computation,
                    exploring problems, or to present their work.
